**Title:**

Electromyography Data Analysis for Prosthetic Arm Development

**Aim of project:** 

This research project aims to investigate the feasibility and potential of analyzing electromyography (EMG) data for the development of prosthetic arms. The research question we aim to answer is whether EMG signals can provide reliable and accurate information about the user's intended movements, which can be used to control prosthetic arms effectively. 



**Approach:** 

Experimental Setup: 

An EMG sensor system will be attached to the limb muscles, allowing us to capture the electrical signals generated during muscle contractions. The prosthetic arms used by the participants will also be equipped with sensors to capture their motion data.


Data Collection:

EMG data will be collected from a group of participants by using a surface EMG device while they perform a variety of tasks, such as opening and closing their hands, reaching for objects, extending fingers and grasping objects.



Data Analysis:

The collected EMG signals will undergo preprocessing to remove noise and artifacts. Feature extraction techniques will be employed to identify relevant patterns and characteristics in the EMG data. Support Vector Machine(SVM) will be used to train a model using the extracted features to establish the relationship between EMG signals and intended movements.

Evaluation:

 The trained models will be evaluated using cross-validation techniques to assess their performance in predicting and reproducing the intended arm movements. Performance metrics, including classification accuracy, regression error, and user feedback, will be analyzed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing EMG data for controlling prosthetic arms.


**Timeline:**


Week 1: Set up the experimental environment, including the EMG sensor array and motion capture system. Recruit participants and obtain informed consent.
Week 2: Familiarize participants with the EMG sensors and perform initial calibration to establish a baseline for muscle activation patterns.
Week 3: Conduct data collection sessions with participants. Record EMG signals while participants perform a variety of hand movements.
Week 4: Preprocess and clean the collected EMG data. Develop feature extraction algorithms to capture relevant information from the signals.
Week 5: Perform data analysis to figure out the relations and insights provided by the data. If time permits, also train and optimize a machine learning model using the extracted features. Implement classification algorithms for mapping EMG signals to specific hand movements.
Week 6: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using cross-validation techniques. Analyze the results and iterate on the algorithms if necessary.
Week 7-8: Summarize findings, draw conclusions, and prepare the final report.
